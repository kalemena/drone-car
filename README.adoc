= Drone - Car

Drone Car controlled by WiFi

Purpose is to leverage IoT spare to pilot an old car model 1/10th.

(this repo serves more as notes than tutorial or full project description)


== BOM

* Some RC car where radio will be deprecated by custom receiver :-)

== Stories

=== Discover nrf24l01 - example tx/rx

If you need full understanding of what is nRF24L01, follow guides in <<src>> for simple sketches.

Here are skectehs copied under link:src/00-discover-rf24[nRF24L01 basic examples folder]

=== Discover servos - example move servos

My Sanwa servos seems very old, not same pinout than others!

Anyway, keep in mind the discrepency!

The pin layout was as follows:

* Pin1 = Signal
* Pin2 = Neg -
* Pin3 = Pos +

Most pin layout is now:

* Pin1 = Signal
* Pin2 = Pos +
* Pin3 Neg -

Just *hook each PWM signal to digital pin of arduino nano* and use sketch such as default arduino link:src/00-discover-servos[servo sketch]

=== Remote controlling - nRF24L01

Creating rx/tx sketches together with the 2 arduino nano with radio.

Below is my 25 year old RC car upgraded prototype:

Once plugged, you can use arduino IDE to send value(s) for each PWM to the receiver which will apply.

link:src/00-rc-nrf24[Test sketches]

I used only 1 PWM to calibrate and result of *Calibration* shows below integers:

* *direction* = 60 to 120 with straight ~90 
* *speed* = 30 to 160 with stop ~95
  95 to 160 : backward faster and faster
  95 to 30  : forward faster and faster

=== Remote controlling - FlySky

Admittedly when you have a Radio Controller, and you learn how easy it is to use, you'd prefer real RC radio modules instead of custom nRF24L01.

This is what is done under link:src/00-discover-radio[FlySky receiver on Arduino]

What this takes is the link:https://npm.pkg.github.com/utkudarilmaz/FlySkyiBus[FlySky iBus Arduino lib] and the example code.
